👋  Hi, my name's Vlad Verteletskiy.
  
🧔🏻  For the past few months I've been learning Java and its side technologies with the goal to become the best kind of programmer I could possibly be. As of now, I've come through a couple of Java courses (Core, OOP, Collections, Streams API, Reflection API, etc., Spring Framework, Android, and Fx), learned SQL (used MySQL, SQLite in some of my pet projects and took a look at Postgres - going to dive deeper into it). I also got some experience with developing Android apps using NoSQL DBs such as Firebase. However, I feel like Spring Framework is what my heart wants to stick to. And for that very reason, I'm currently looking for a chance to work on an actual Java-based web project among other professionals, who have already come up the path I'm on. 
  
💞️  I prefer Maven over Gradle, IDEA over Eclipse, and pizza over burgers. 

📫  I have no commercial experience yet (😿), so I'm literally dreaming of getting a chance to apply my skills working within a team in a trainee or junior Java dev position and to keep growing my programming skills.
Please feel free to shoot me an email to **verteletskiyv@gmail.com** or a message to my Telegram - **@verteletskiyv** if I (somehow?) piqued your curiosity :)
